The Fervojo font family is a geometric sans-serif typeface inspired by the numeric typefaces in the subway system of Tokyo, Japan. The Fervojo font has been developed with the idea of creating organized text bodies, resulting in an industrial and retro-futuristic taste. Additionary, it can support a wide range of Latin and Greek alphabets, commonly used in Western and Central-European languages, Chinese Pinyin, and Esperanto.
